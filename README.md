# MSc Business Analytics Capstone Project  
## AI-Powered Food Waste and CO₂ Tracking in Retail  
**In collaboration with Deloitte**

---

### 📚 Overview  
This repository contains the key deliverables, data references, and supporting resources for my MSc Business Analytics Capstone Project.  

The project focuses on **reducing retail food waste and associated carbon emissions in Ireland** by developing a **Generative AI–powered decision support system**. The solution integrates **Microsoft Power BI analytics**, a **Gemini API–powered web application**, and **scenario modelling** to provide actionable recommendations for store managers and ESG analysts.  

The artefact serves as a **proof of concept** for Deloitte’s sustainability advisory services, showcasing how AI can operationalise waste reduction and carbon accounting strategies at the store level.
